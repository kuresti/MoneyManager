# Overview

This project was built for me to learn Java and to further my skills in object oriented programming. 

The project I choose to created is a Money Manager. This is an app that is viewed and interacted with in the CLI. From the CLI a user enters what action he would like to do from a menu numbered 1-6. Those actions include adding an expense, adding a deposit, viewing a list of expenses which includes the total of all expenses at the end of a list, viewing a list of deposits also includes a total of deposits, and viewing viewing all transactions with a total balance at the end of the list.

I choose this project so that I could learn the Java language. I also choose this project because I thought it would be fun to see if I could create a money manager of my own that could work for my own finances. In this project I learned a lot about Java and also gained more of an understanding of object oriented programming. This project was challenging in that I was learning a new language. What came as a pleasant surprise is that although the syntax was different from other languages I have learned, Java implements a lot of the same tools of other programming languages. Tools such as conditionals, loops, lists, and classes. This made learning Java a little easier in that I understood how the tools worked.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
